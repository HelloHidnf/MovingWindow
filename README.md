# MovingWindow
this is a project that I made because I was bored and made it be able to go across multiple screens for the same reason
## It auto detects the layout of your monitors, it won't disappear
#### This application is jittery because I cba to make it good
I'm probably only going to d oa single release of this
surprisingly low resource usage, saw it using 0% CPU at some point
### this application is useless


# How to use
1.  Install the latest version from releases (windows defender will probably block dlls even though it's ones that *they* created)
2.  run the exe file in the folder
3.  either click the button at the bottom of the window or drag and drop a file
4.  to close it, do it from the taskbar :)
